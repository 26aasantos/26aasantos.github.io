/**
 * ExperienceGrid - the Experience view as a fixed viewport.
 *
 * Two columns inside one glass sheet: the video proof on the left, the client
 * ledger on the right. The page is sized to the panel and does not scroll, so
 * both clips share ONE stage and a picker switches between them rather than
 * stacking two players down a column that would never fit.
 *
 * Clips can disagree about orientation, so the stage is ONE fixed plate that
 * each is contained inside. Letting the frame take each clip's own ratio made
 * it jump size on every switch; a single plate keeps the card the same object
 * whichever is playing.
 *
 * To add a video: drop the .mp4 in public/experience/, set its `src` below
 * (e.g. '/experience/client-1.mp4'), and swap the poster for a still from
 * the clip. With `src` empty the cover stays up and play is disabled.
